## Facial Expression Recognition with Keras
----------------------------------------

+ Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras

+ Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)

+ Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask

+ Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data

The tasks for the project are:

+ **Task 1**: Explore the Dataset

+ **Task 2**: Generate Training and Validation Batches

+ **Task 3**: Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

+ **Task 4**: Train and Evaluate Model

+ **Task 5**: Save and Serialize Model as JSON String

+ **Task 6**: Create a Flask App to Serve Predictions

+ **Task 7**: Create a Class to Output Model Predictions

+ **Task 8**: Design an HTML Template for the Flask App

+ **Task 9**: Use Model to Recognize Facial Expressions in Videos
